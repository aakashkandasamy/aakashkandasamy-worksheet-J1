Fault Localization is the process of narrowing down the search in a faulty program to figure out exactly where the fault lies. We try to identify the exactl location of these faults and bugs in a software system. One of the techniques used here is by **analyzing test results and program execution traces**, which allows us to pinpoint the specific portions of the code that are problematic. This can **significantly reduce debugging time** as well as improve the **efficiency** of the process.

- TDD makes people write smaller and more modular code that is easeier to test and maintain.
- Writing the test cases before coding ensures developers can catch potential issues early on in the development process
- Lesser time is spent on debugging later so TDD can also lead to quicker development as the code is constantly tested and verified

- It must have at least one number.
  - At least one numeric character (0-9)
  - No numeric characters
- It must have at least one uppercase letter.
  - At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
  - No uppercase letters
- It must have at least one lowercase letter.
  - At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
  - No lowercase letters
- It must not contain the website gmail anywhere. (For example if we were generating a password for gmail accounts)
  - Password contains "gmail"
  - Password does not contain "gmail"
- It can only be made up of letters, numbers, and the underscore.
  - Only valid characters used
  - Invalid characters used (e.g., symbols like !, @, #, etc.)

Although there is a loop withing nodes 3 and 4, the paths are covered in a manner which allows the loop to be exercised while still being abel to reach the endpoint, which means infiniste traversal is avoided - this is a _**finite set**_.

6.
Mutation testing ensures that the test suite is robust and catches faults (mutations) in the code. By introducing these changes and checking if the tests fail, mutation testing can verigy that the tests are thorough. Here are the [lecture notes on mutation testing](https://cs2113-f24.github.io/j/software_testing).
